To run, run the demo.py program, this will populate the database with the correct amount of information
to run a visual run the GUI file, this will launch a GUI application.

This project will pull from the college score card api.. vers2.0 it now uploads this to a sqlite db
the program can also accept a excel file and convert it into the database and handle the file
GUI: I am using PyQt5 to handle the graphics
the Program will load editable data from both excel and sqlite

you can also choose to have a map visualization when running the app in form of choropleth map (will display in browser)
im not total sure if my comparisons are correct but im short on time (the choropleth map took me a long time)


Testing: GUI test plan: I wish I had more time to get into GUI testing but my plan is to run both test scripts
assert test cases, and most importantly user testing experience
